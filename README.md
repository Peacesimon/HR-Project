## Project Tittle: HR Data Analysis
This appears to be an HR data analysis dashboard for an Incubator Hub, showing various metrics related to employee attrition and workforce demographics. Let me break down the key insights:

Overall Numbers:
- Total Employees: 1,470
- Attrition Count: 237 employees have left
- Current Employees: 1,233
- Attrition Rate: 16%
- Average Age: 37 years

Departmental Attrition:
- The pie chart shows attrition across three departments:
  - R&D had the highest attrition (133 employees)
  - Sales (92 employees)
  - HR (12 employees)

Educational Field Distribution of Attrition:
- Life Sciences shows the highest attrition (around 80 employees)
- Medical field is second (about 64 employees)
- Marketing and Technical fields show moderate attrition (around 35 and 32 employees respectively)
- Other fields and Technical Degree show lower attrition rates (11 and 7 employees respectively)

Gender Distribution of Attrition:
- Male employees account for 63.29% of attrition
- Female employees account for 36.71% of attrition

This visualization suggests that:
1. The organization has a significant attrition challenge, particularly in R&D and Life Sciences
2. There's a gender imbalance in attrition, with males leaving at a higher rate
3. Technical and support roles seem to have better retention than scientific and sales roles

Would you like me to analyze any particular aspect of this data in more detail?
