## Project Tittle: HR Data Analysis
This appears to be an HR data analysis dashboard for an Incubator Hub, showing various metrics related to employee attrition and workforce demographics. Let me break down the key insights:

Overall Numbers:
- Total Employees: 1,470
- Attrition Count: 237 employees have left
- Current Employees: 1,233
- Attrition Rate: 16%
- Average Age: 37 years

Departmental Attrition:
- The pie chart shows attrition across three departments:
  - R&D had the highest attrition (133 employees)
  - Sales (92 employees)
  - HR (12 employees)

Educational Field Distribution of Attrition:
- Life Sciences shows the highest attrition (around 80 employees)
- Medical field is second (about 64 employees)
- Marketing and Technical fields show moderate attrition (around 35 and 32 employees respectively)
- Other fields and Technical Degree show lower attrition rates (11 and 7 employees respectively)

Gender Distribution of Attrition:
- Male employees account for 63.29% of attrition
- Female employees account for 36.71% of attrition

This visualization suggests that:
1. The organization has a significant attrition challenge, particularly in R&D and Life Sciences
2. There's a gender imbalance in attrition, with males leaving at a higher rate
3. Technical and support roles seem to have better retention than scientific and sales roles

, specifically showing data for the Human Resources department. Let me break down what I see:
Overall Numbers:

Total Employees: 27
Attrition Count: 7 employees have left
Current Employees: 20
Attrition Rate: 26%
Average Age: 37 years

Key Insights:

Department Focus:

The data shows only HR department attrition (7 employees)
The pie chart shows a single blue section representing HR

### 




Educational Backgroun:

All 7 employees who left had Human Resources educational backgrounds
This suggests the department hires primarily from HR educational programs


Gender Distribution:

Male: 57.14% of attrition (approximately 4 employees)
Female: 42.86% of attrition (approximately 3 employees)



Concerning Patterns:

High Attrition Rate:

The 26% attrition rate is significantly higher than the overall rate of 16% seen in the previous dashboard
This suggests retention issues specific to the HR department


Small Team Impact:

With only 27 total employees, losing 7 represents a substantial portion of the workforce
This level of turnover could significantly impact operations and institutional knowledge



Recommendations:

Conduct exit interviews to understand why HR professionals are leaving
Review compensation and career development opportunities
Assess workload and team structure given the small team size
Develop retention strategies specifically for HR professionals
Consider implementing mentorship programs to improve engagement
